<h1>Code examples for Polycom KWS XML-RPC</h1>

<p>This is a number of XML-RPC samples used to demonstrate the use of the XML-RPC API for the Polycom
KWS products - currently KWS300 and KWS6000.</p>

<p>One sample is written in Java, one in Visual Basic .NET and the rest in Python. The samples are simple
and easy to understand even if you do not know the Python language. This README explains how to get
started with the examples.</p>

<h2>Java example</h2>

<p>This is a sample illustrating how to access the Polycom KWS XML-RPC interface from Java. The sample
uses Apache RPC-XML package for the XML-RPC client. The package is included and can be obtained from
<a href="http://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/">http://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/</a>.</p>

<h3>Executing the example</h3>

<p>The samples are tested with OpenJDK java build 1.6.0_0-b14 and Sun java build 1.6.0_07-b06.</p>

<p>To use the sample modify SendSMS.java to match your test system, compile and execute the command:</p>

<p>Linux</p>
<pre>./sendsms.sh</pre>

<p>Microsoft Windows</p>
<pre>sendsms.bat</pre>

<h2>Visual Basic .NET example</h2>

<p>This is a sample illustrating how to access the Polycom KWS XML-RPC interface from Visual Basic .NET. The sample
uses the Cook Computing RPC-XML library for the XML-RPC client. The library is included and can be obtained from
<a href="http://www.xml-rpc.net/">http://www.xml-rpc.net/</a>. The sample is created using
Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2010.</p>

<h2>Python examples</h2>

<p>There is a number of Python XML-RPC samples used to demonstrate the use of the XML-RPC API for the Polycom
KWS products - currently KWS300 and KWS6000.</p>

<h3>Obtaining Python</h3>
<p>The samples are tested with Python version 2.7. Please be aware that Python 3.x is a lot different from
Python 2.x and the samples will not work with Python 3.x.</p>

<p>Linux</p>
<p>Most Linux distributions are shipped with Python installed. If Python is not installed use
your package manager to install Python.</p>

<p>Microsoft Windows</p>
<p>Download Python from <a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a> and install.</p>

<h3>Executing the examples</h3>

<p>To use the samples modify the files to match your test system and execute the command:</p>

<pre>python &lt;sample-file&gt; &lt;KWS address&gt; &lt;to extension&gt;</pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>python sendsms.py 192.168.0.1 2601</pre>
